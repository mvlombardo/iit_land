In this project we investigate phenomena relevant to the `neural noise` hypothesis of autism. We utilize in-vivo neuroimaging data to characterize signal complexity of the neural time-series and relate these signal complexity metrics back to biological mechanisms relevant to neural noise (e.g., excitation:inhibition balance).
