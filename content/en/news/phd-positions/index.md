**3 PhD positions available**

Come join the lab!

We're looking for 3 talented PhD students to join the lab in November 2019. Students can apply through the University of Trento, Center for Mind/Brain Sciences [(CIMeC)](https://www.cimec.unitn.it/en).

This project is centered around understanding how typically developing individuals or patients with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders fractionate into subtypes with differing clinical or developmental manifestations and/or different underlying mechanisms (e.g., genomics, neural circuitry, cognition, developmental trajectories). The research uses methods and approaches from a variety of fields such as genomics, neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI, MEG, EEG), eye tracking, experimental psychology, and data science.

Ideal candidates could have any or all of the following backgrounds and/or substantive prior experience:

1) collecting data and working with children and/or patient populations relevant to the project (e.g., autism, other neurodevelopmental disorders)

2) methodologies relevant to the project (e.g., fMRI, MEG, EEG, eye tracking, bioinformatics);
3) existing strong computational skills (e.g., machine learning, advanced statistics, R, Python, MATLAB) or strong potential and motivation to develop such skills.

Additional skills/expertise that are advantageous would be prior training or skills with phlebotomy and/or prior wet lab experience.

For further information, candidates are encouraged to get in contact with the PI (Michael Lombardo) and should have a look at this paper describing the general approach (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0321-0), as well as these prior papers as examples of the kinds of work we do in the lab.
