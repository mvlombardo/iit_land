bio: I am a PhD student at the Laboratory for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders (LAND) under the supervision of Dr. Michael Lombardo. I got my BSc as a Childhood Neuro and Psychomotor Therapist at the University of Milano and I got a MSc in Cognitive Science at CIMeC (Centre for Mind and Brain Sciences) at the University of Trento. My research main interests are neurodevelopmental disorders, with a specific focus on Autism and ADHD, and childhood movement development. My PhD goal is to better understand how motor behaviour is related and influence autism spectrum heterogeneity.
