I'm a Senior Researcher at the Center for Neuroscience and Cognitive Systems [(CNCS)](https://cncs.iit.it) at the [Italian Institute of Technology (IIT)](https://www.iit.it) in Rovereto, Italy. I direct the Laboratory for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders (LAND). IIT LAND's translational research program is focused on understanding heterogeneity and early developmental mechanisms involved in autism and atypical neurodevelopment.
