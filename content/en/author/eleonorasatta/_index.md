bio: I am interested in studying brain development to understand how we learn to make sense of other people’s actions. I took a Master’s degree in Developmental Psychology. During my PhD, I studied how inter-personal coordination skills develop in children using a joint-action paradigm. During my previous postdocs I analyzed single cell recordings, eye tracking, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. I am now working on developing novel eye tracking and EEG/MEG paradigms to investigate action understanding skills in autistic children.

===================

I am interested in studying brain development to understand how we learn to make sense of other people’s actions. I took a Master’s degree in Developmental Psychology. During my PhD, I studied how inter-personal coordination skills develop in children using a joint-action paradigm. During my previous postdocs I analyzed single cell recordings, eye tracking, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. I am now working on developing novel eye tracking and EEG/MEG paradigms to investigate action understanding skills in autistic children.
