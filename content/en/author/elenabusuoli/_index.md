bio: I am a PhD student at the Laboratory for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders (LAND) under the supervision of Dr. Michael Lombardo. I have studied Neuropsychology at the University of Florence. After my Master’s degree I did an internship in Fondazione Stella Maris, University of Pisa, where I have received a scholarship involved in autism research. My primary focus is to better understand the variety of gaps in autism research that are scattered throughout several different domains, from genetics, to neuroscience, to intervention.
