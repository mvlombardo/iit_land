# Short bio
bio: I am a PhD student at the Laboratory for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders (LAND) under the supervision of Dr. Michael Lombardo. I hold a Masters in Cognitive Neuroscience from CIMeC (Trento University), where I also stayed for some time as a Research Assistant. I now plan on using unsupervised learning techniques to investigate potential biomarkers behind phenotypical heterogeneity in ASD.
