In 1985 Baron-Cohen formulated and went on to test the ‘mindblindness’ theory of autism. In 1997, he formulated and went on to test the ‘fetal sex steroid’ theory of autism. He has also made contributions to the fields of autism prevalence and screening, autism genetics, autism neuroimaging, autism and technical ability, typical cognitive sex differences, and synaesthesia. In 1999 Baron-Cohen created the first UK clinic for adults with suspected Asperger Syndrome, called the CLASS clinic (Cambridge Lifespan Asperger Syndrome Service), at a time when the National Health Service (NHS) did not see the clinical need for this. This has helped over 1,000 patients to have their disability recognized, the “lost generation” of adults who had missed out on diagnosis in childhood, and has been used to create a model for similar clinical services all over the UK.

Baron-Cohen has received awards from the British Psychological Society (BPS) (Spearman Medal); the American Psychological Association (McCandless Award); the BPS (May Davison Award); the Autism Award Philadelphia Autism Association/Princeton University; the Presidents’ Award (BPS); the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BA), Joseph Lister Lecturer; the Lifetime Achievement Award, MENSA; and Kanner-Asperger Medal (German Society for Research into Autism).
