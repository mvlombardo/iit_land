Dr Gozzi received a master degree in Biotechnology at the University of Verona (Italy) in 1998. Afterwards he joined the neuroscience centre of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), a large research-based pharmaceutical company based in Verona (Italy) and Harlow (UK). At GSK he pioneered the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to describe the neural substrates modulated by pharmacological agents, a line of research that he  also pursued to obtain a PhD degree in biomedical imaging with the University of Verona.

During his years at GSK he took on roles of increasing responsibility, and developed a strong background in MRI, image processing and analysis, as well as in the application of translational approaches to study neuropsychiatric brain disorders.

In 2010 Dr Gozzi joined the [Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia](https://www.iit.it), where he leads the [Functional Neuroimaging Laboratory](https://www.iit.it/research/lines/functional-neuroimaging). The lab is equipped with a 4-channel 7 Tesla MRI scanner for in vivo imaging. 

Dr Gozzi's research has described the circuital substrates modulated by centrally-active agents in multiple areas of experimental neuroscience (e.g. schizophrenia, depression, drug addiction etc.) and identified functional and structural alterations in different rodent models of brain pathology. More recently, he have demonstrated the feasibility of using fMRI in combination with pharmaco-genetic silencing to dissect the circuital basis of complex behaviors, and demonstrated for the first time that the mouse brain contains distributed resting-state functional connectivity networks, including plausible homologues of the human default-mode (DMN) and salience networks.

Dr Gozzi's current research is primarily focused on the application of advanced MRI methods to investigate the large-scale neurofunctional architecture of the mouse brain, and describe its modulation by neurodevelopmental and pathological effectors. A major goal of his research is to probe the activity of functional network systems as a novel cross-species translational language that can be related to specific behaviours, cognitive processes and neuropathological traits.
